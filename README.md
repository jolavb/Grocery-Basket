<h3> Grocery-Basket Overview </h3>
  I have developed this Single Page Application out of my own frustration at reliably acessing and aggregating
on sale grocery items into recipies. The goal of Grocery-Basket is to allow
the collection and aggregation of on-sale grocery items from the greater boston area into cheap and delicious recipies. Food item and store html
data are collected weekly and stored in a postgres db running on heroku.

  This first version of Grocery-Basket allows a user to select a grocery store to display and add on-sale items to thier cart. Cart
items may be updated or deleted and a user may use the cart as a reference while shopping at thier local grocery store.



<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
1. Javascript
